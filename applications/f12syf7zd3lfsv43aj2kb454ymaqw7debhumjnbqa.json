    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Together, DPLA's partners steward over 50 million items that reflect the rich tapestry of our nation’s cultural heritage—from photographs and oral histories to government documents and artwork. DPLA has long served as a connector between libraries, archives, and museums and emerging technologies that can enhance access and preservation. As part of this tradition, our current project explores how decentralized storage, specifically Filecoin, can be used to preserve cultural materials at scale. This pilot initiative in collaboration with FFDW aims to store a portion of a DPLA partner’s collection on Filecoin, assessing its effectiveness in ensuring durability, openness, and resistance to censorship, and sharing those findings with our broader community.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "Yes",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The data being stored onto Filecoin consists of a curated selection of cultural heritage materials from DPLA’s partner institutions. This includes digitized photographs, manuscripts, government documents, oral histories, and other historically significant records that reflect the diverse stories and experiences across the United States. These materials were chosen to represent a meaningful subset of our partners’ collections, helping us evaluate how decentralized storage can support long-term preservation, open access, and resilience against loss or censorship.",
